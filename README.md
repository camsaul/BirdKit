BirdKit
=======

iOS Classes and Categories Used Throughout LuckyBird's Apps.

Right now if you would like to use BirdKit you can either A) add it as a subproject in Xcode, make it a build dependency (and link to the static library 'libBirdKit.a') or B) build the static library and drag-and-drop it into your Xcode project. Either way you'll want to add the BirdKit folder to your user header search paths (recursive).

CocoaPods distribution and proper documentation are forthcoming.
